1. PreventBlock - A custom block-compression system for **PreventHopper-ORE**
Part I - Introduction

**What is PreventBlock?** As stated above, it's a custom JavaScript expansion that
allow players/users to interact with the PreventHopper's data file, therefore allowing
for the modification of ore data, which then allow for the creation of the block
compression system, a system which allows players to craft an unlimited amount of blocks
in a matter of seconds, with no effort and no physical limit to the storage system.
