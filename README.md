# CustomCore - Public cores (13/05/2021)

**Core No.1** - PreventBlock - A custom block-compression system for **PreventHopper-ORE**.

**What is PreventBlock?** As stated above, it's a custom JavaScript expansion that
allow players/users to interact with the PreventHopper's data file, therefore allowing
for the modification of ore data, which then allow for the creation of the block
compression system, a system which allows players to craft an unlimited amount of blocks
in a matter of seconds, with no effort and no physical limit to the storage system.

**Dependencies:** The code relies on a few main plugins in order to work, which would of
course include PreventHopper itself, as well as a few other plugins, but it's up to the
likings of administrators to adjust the dependencies in the code itself.

**What can it do?** The script acts as a placeholder for PlaceholderAPI itself, as well as
a "plugin", if you could say it that way. As of right now, the core can do several things
such as: Compress ores into blocks, Send blocks within your storage to others, Convert
the blocks to SuperiorCore's Wand Database, and send the blocks to other SuperiorCore
databases - For player's with custom BuildWands to use.
